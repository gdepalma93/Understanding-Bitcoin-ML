### Bitcoin Understandings
**Bitcoin Summary**   
Bitcoin is P2P electronic money that is valuable over legacy systems because of the monetary autonomy it brings to its users. Bitcoin seeks to address the root problem with conventional currency: all the trust that's required to make it work -- Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof, decentralized networks and open source software Bitcoin minimizes and replaces these trust costs.



What are the Primary Functions of Money?   
1. Medium of Exchange  
2. Store of Value

Bitcoin as Medium of Exchange. Transactions are:   
1. Permissionless & Borderless   
2. Anonymous  
3. Private   
4. Censorship Resistant   
5. Fast   
6. Cheap   
7. Irreversible   
8. Online and avalable 24/7 365   

Bitcoin as a Store of Value 
1. Cannot be printed or debased. **Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist**     
2. No storage costs. Bitcoin is completely Digital and takes no physical space regardless of ammount  
3. Are easy to Protect & Hide. Can be stored on a phone, computer, encrypted on a paper back up or memorized in your head.
4. No counterparty Risk. If you keep the private key of a bitcoin secret and the transaction has enough confirmations(6 blocks deep), then nobody can take them from you no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.  


Major Risks as an investment
* Still new and relatively unproven   
* Volatile   
* Extremely Technical
